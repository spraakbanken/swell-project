# SweLL correction annotation guidelines

The purpose of correction annotation is to categorize the corrections made in a learner text so the learner corpus becomes searchable for different types of deviations from the target language norm. The annotation of the learner texts according to the SweLL-projects correction-taxonomy is hence an important step in making the learner language collected in the corpus analyzable for SLA-research purposes.Correction annotation always includes an element of interpretation since we cannot be exactly sure what the learner had in mind when attempting to express a certain content with a certain linguistic structure or expression.

## General

  * This is where you find the code book: https://github.com/spraakbanken/swell-project/blob/master/Error_code_book.md 
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * Likewise, if we see there are guidelines missing, we should add a suggestion, or flag for further consideration - with    examples, so that the suggestion is interpretable!

## Specific guidelines for different correction types

### Lexical corrections - general function
---
The correction-taxonomy contains six (?) diffent codes for lexical corrections. 

* L (wrong word or phrase)
* L-DER (expl) 
* L-FL (non-swedish word)
* L-ID (expl)
* L-M (missing content word)
* L-Ref (reference correction)
