# SweLL correction annotation guidelines

The purpose of correction annotation is to categorize the corrections made in a learner text so the learner corpus becomes searchable for different types of deviations from the target language norm. The annotation of the learner texts according to the SweLL-projects correction-taxonomy is hence an important step in making the learner language collected in the corpus analyzable for SLA-research purposes. The normalization (see normalization guidelines) and in prolonging also the correction annotation of learner language always includes an element of interpretation since we cannot be exactly sure what the learner had in mind when attempting to express a certain content with a certain linguistic structure or expression. This document therefore contains guidence on how to apply the SeLL-annotation taxonomy in order to minimize ambiguity and ensure the greatest possible inter-annotater agreement. We first give some general guidelines and thereafter describe specific abigiuos cases that might accure in relation to the differnt corrections types.

## General
---
  * This is where you find the code book: https://github.com/spraakbanken/swell-project/blob/master/Error_code_book.md 
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * Likewise, if we see there are guidelines missing, we should add a suggestion, or flag for further consideration - with    examples, so that the suggestion is interpretable!

## Specific guidelines for different correction types

### Lexical corrections - general function
---
The correction-taxonomy contains six (?) diffent codes for lexical corrections. 

* L (wrong word or phrase)
* L-DER (expl) 
* L-FL (non-swedish word)
* L-ID (expl)
* L-M (missing content word)
* L-Ref (reference correction)

## Morfological codes (8?)
  
---

### Morforlogical correction - general function

The SweLL-taxonomy further cantain eight morfological codes.

* M-ADJ/ADV (confusions of adjective and adverbial endings)
* M-Case (corrections regarding the use of genitive (nouns) and dativ forms (pronouns))
* M-DEF (deviation in definite/indefinite forms)
* M-F   (deviant paradigm selection, but correct grammatical category)
* M-GEND (dorrection regarding grammatical gender)
* M-NUM (deviation in number agreement)
* M-other (ambigeous cases with several possible target hypothesies)
* M-VERB (covers deviations in the verb phrase, i.e. aspect, tempus, modus)

### Some specific guidelines regarding morfological correction

## M-DEF
_corrections regarding the use of definite/indefinite form can apply both to single words, groups of words and a missing/redundant article_

## M-F
_something about can do here_

## M-NUM
_corrections regarding the deviations in number agreement  can apply  to single words or groups of words. Mark elements that should agree with each other, if they are not “separated”![förtydliga!!]_

## M-other
_This code is to be applied when there is no convincing arguments for any  other morphological code._

## Orthographical codes (2)

---

### Orthographiacal correction - general function

The taxonomy disinguishes two different types of orthographical corrections

* O-CAP (correction  regarding capitalization (upper / lower))
* O-COMP (correction regarding compounds, that is oversplitting or overcompounding)
