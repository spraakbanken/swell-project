## General
---
  * This is where you find the code book: https://github.com/spraakbanken/swell-project/blob/master/Error_code_book.md 
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * Likewise, if we see there are guidelines missing, we should add a suggestion, or flag for further consideration - with    examples, so that the suggestion is interpretable!
