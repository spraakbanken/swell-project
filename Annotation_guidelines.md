# SweLL correction annotation guidelines

The purpose of correction annotation is to categorize the corrections made in a learner text so the learner corpus becomes searchable for different types of deviations from the target language norm. The annotation of the learner texts according to the SweLL-projects correction-taxonomy is hence an important step in making the learner language collected in the corpus analyzable for SLA-research purposes. The normalization (see normalization guidelines) and in prolonging also the correction annotation of learner language always includes an element of interpretation since we cannot be exactly sure what the learner had in mind when attempting to express a certain content with a certain linguistic structure or expression. This document therefore contains guidence on how to apply the SeLL-annotation taxonomy in order to minimize ambiguity and ensure the greatest possible inter-annotater agreement. We first give some general guidelines and thereafter describe specific abigiuos cases that might accure in relation to the differnt corrections types.

## General
---
  * This is where you find the code book: https://github.com/spraakbanken/swell-project/blob/master/Error_code_book.md 
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * If the same text segment contains more that one error type, add all error tags that are necessary
  * Likewise, if we see there are guidelines missing, we should add a suggestion, or flag for further consideration - with    examples, so that the suggestion is interpretable!

## Specific guidelines for different correction types

### Lexical corrections - general function
---
The correction-taxonomy contains six (?) diffent codes for lexical corrections. 

* L (wrong word or phrase)
* L-DER (expl) 
* L-FL (non-swedish word)
* L-ID (expl)
* L-M (missing content word)
* L-Ref (reference correction)
  
---

### Some specific guiudelines regarding lexical corrections

## L-FL

_L-FL applies to the use of an **existing** non-swedish word, i.e. a foreign word that is NOT conventionally used in Swedish and can be identified as an existing word in another language. Naturally annotators will not be able to identify all such cases, since we cannot expect them to be competent in all relevant languages, but it is still relevant to mark cases where possible_

## L or L-FL?

_Crosslinguistic infuence lexical that can be indentified from the context but where the writer has formed a "Swedish" word from e.g. an Englinsh stem (see example below) is marked as L (wrong word), NOT L-FL_

[insert illutrated example --> busiga --> buisy här!]


## Morfological codes (8?)
  
---

### Morforlogical correction - general function

The SweLL-taxonomy further cantain eight morfological codes.

* M-ADJ/ADV (confusions of adjective and adverbial endings)
* M-Case (corrections regarding the use of genitive (nouns) and dativ forms (pronouns))
* M-DEF (deviation in definite/indefinite forms)
* M-F   (deviant paradigm selection, but correct grammatical category)
* M-GEND (dorrection regarding grammatical gender)
* M-NUM (deviation in number agreement)
* M-other (ambigeous cases with several possible target hypothesies)
* M-VERB (covers deviations in the verb phrase, i.e. aspect, tempus, modus)

---

### Some specific guidelines regarding morfological correction

## M-DEF
_corrections regarding the use of definite/indefinite form can apply both to single words, groups of words and a missing/redundant article_

## M-F
_something about can do here_

## M-NUM
_corrections regarding the deviations in number agreement  can apply  to single words or groups of words. Mark elements that should agree with each other, if they are not “separated”![förtydliga!!]_

## M-other
_This code is to be applied when there is no convincing arguments for any  other morphological code._ 

---

## Orthographical codes (3)

---

### Orthographiacal correction - general function

The taxonomy disinguishes two different types of orthographical corrections

* O (orthographic/spelling correction)
* O-CAP (correction  regarding capitalization (upper / lower))
* O-COMP (correction regarding compounds, that is oversplitting or overcompounding)

---

### Some specific guidelines regarding orthographical corrections

## Punctuation codes (4)
---

### Punctuation correction - general functions

The are four different punctuation code in the SweLL-taxonomy

* P-W (wrong punctuation)
* P-R (redundant punctuation)
* P-M (missing punctuation)

---

### Some specific guideline regarding punctuation correction

?
  
---

### Sentence segmentation code (1)
---

### Sentence segmentation correction - general function

The taxonomy also contains one code regarding sentence-segmentation corrections

* SENT-segmentation (merging, or splitting a sentence)
---

### Some specific guideline regarding sentence segmentation correction

_[Note! This error type needs to be tested whether it can be coded through other codes]
This code is only to be used where punctuation codes cannot be applied._

---

## Syntactical codes (6)
---

### Syntactical corrections - general function

The SweLL-taxonomy contains six codes regarding syntactical corrections

* S-adv (word order error involving adverbial placement)
* S-finV (word order error with finite verb placement)
* S-Msubj (subject missing)
* S-M (grammatical word missing, e.g. particle, reflexive pronoun, connector, auxiliry verbs[??])
* S-R (word or phrase redundant)
* S-WO (word or phrase order - other)
  
---

### Some specific guidelines regarding syntatical corrections

## S-Msubj vs L-M/(S-M?)

_[Here we need to adress the possible overlap/ambiguity between the lexical and syntactical codes when it comes to missing words/syntactical functions]

---

## Intelligebility (1)
---

### Intelligebility corrections - general function

There is one code for marking intelligeble parts of a learner text

* X (impossible to interpret the writer’s intention with a word, phrase or sentence)
  
---

## Unidentified
---

### Unidentifies´d corrections - general function

The taxonomy also contains one code for marking corrections that cannot be categorized according to other codes

*Uni
